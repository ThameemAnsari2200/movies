Instructions on how to use

1. Download and open the project in eclipse.
2. Select the project, Right Click and, move to Run As and click on Spring Boot App

4. Movies List link will display list of movies taken from movies.Json file.
5. Create movies link will allow to add new movie information to the movies.json
6. Edit/Delete will allow to either edit or delete a movie from movies.json and the same will be updated on the movies list grid.
