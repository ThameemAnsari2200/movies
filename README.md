#Spring Boot Web Application
This repository has the project files for a movie assessment using JSON file

In this part, I would like to demonstrate how to setup a Spring MVC controller to support CRUD operations, and Thymeleaf templates for the web application.

Instructions on how to use

Download and open the project in eclipse.
Select the project, Right Click and, move to Run As and click on Spring Boot App
Access the Link using http://localhost:9091/movies
Movies List link will display list of movies taken from movies.Json file.
Create movies link will allow to add new movie information to the movies.json
Edit/Delete will allow to either edit or delete a movie from movies.json and the same will be updated on the movies list grid.
